### MIDTERM
- two pages report -> is written in profs slides from 221124

### MIDTERM PRESENTATION


### ENDTERM PRESENTATION
- [ ] tell 9 jan next week

- final presentation:
  - start directly with the objective
  - we want to solve planning, but with exploration then we want subtask strategy
  - very short explain the speciality of SAC-X / MetaRL
    - core idea, why it helps to nagivation problem (1 slide)
  - put slides in the appendix 

  - all the setup/model details go in to the appendix
  - but shortly tell what all subtasks are in a list of sub sparse rewards
  - maybe explain one special sub task
  - then skip to results
  - and explain everything even if they fail
  - inform prof BÃ¤uml directly about when we should present by eMail 

#### ENDTERM REPORT
- add what failed
- never descripbe the history, 
- write it as you already had the final idea right from the start
- so that the paper is not a huge version
