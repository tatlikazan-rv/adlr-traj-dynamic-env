## Environment
### Continous
- [X] we can still use Astar to train in grid world and project the info in the  cont env.
 - [X] possible but not really necessary? rrt* for constinious global
  - no just project star
### Obstacles
- [ ] add curricilum basically incrementally adding more and more obstacles
- [ ] moveing obst move and stop and start again, traj generation put it in the ENDTERMPPT
- we assume that we have obstacle IDs
### Collision Check
- [ ] only give the closest 2 obstacles during dynamic
  - like a field of view
  - octadrant as team 4 as a clooab test?
  - or does this go too much into the representation?
  - more obstacles in states mean possibility to develop strategy
  - explanation would be in an AD scenario this is the case, closest matter more
  - the global nagivation is solved by pretraining
    - pretrain on the initial state!! resembles more to the real scenario e.g. AD in roundabout with pedestrian crossing 
    - https://deepai.org/publication/pretraining-in-deep-reinforcement-learning-a-survey  
  - a nice exprement would be to train an agent w/o pretrain and compare, this would be completely un biased -> see SAC-X below

- 1. check for all collisions in the next step
- 2. check foir closest 2
- 3. subtask: get away from obstacle compare obs_distance_diff and give reward if gets bigger
- 4. physics sim solver?? later

### Reward Func
#### Sub sparse Rewards
  
## Algorithm
#### SAC-X

#### SAC
- [ ] easy implementation of SAC to switch to SAC-X
- there is also SAC2 but we want the comparison with SAC and SAC-X so we dont use it

##### JUMP START IDEA
- [ ] only give the init static state even without moving obstacels to the pretraining, then add moving to the normal training
### Policy
### Networks
#### Inputs

#### Outputs

## Optimizer -> **after midterm**
### Loss
## Performance -> **after midterm**
- [X] comparison to other papers?? 
    - we cant as RL is bad in other environaments as we overfit to our representation and task

### Curves -> **after midterm**


### Google Cloud -> **after midterm**


## MILE STONES



### MIDTERM PRESENTATION
- [ ] possible to see other teams PPTs?
  - if i remember correctly they were gonna be shared right?
### MIDTERM REPORT

### ENDTERM PRESENTATION
- e.g. obstacle traj generation pseudo code 
#### as Appexdix

### ENDTERM REPORT

### EXAM
- you can take the exam again only next sem if you fail, but not the project
- note is an average of

## COLLAB TEAM 7 ?
- add curricilum basically incrementally adding more adn more obstacle
- moveing obst move and stop and start again, generation
- pretrain on the initial state!! resembles more to the real scenario
- rrt* for constinious global
-
