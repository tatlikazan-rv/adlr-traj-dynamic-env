# Future Topics

## Organizational

## Environment

### Obstacles
### Collision Check
### Reward Func
- How to incorporate sub-sparse rewards methos from  MetaRL/SAC-X
    - e.g. to solve the recursive same movement problems we face at static environments
    - as the mixed environment is very crucial
  
## RL Method
### Algorithm
#### SAC
#### SAC-X / Meta-RL
- [ ] SAC-X/Meta-RL Paper Qs 
  - wait until we have a working model
  - and then depending on where it goes choose one to implement
  - as the papers
### Networks
#### Inputs
- [ ] Maybe use normalized input for v_x & v_y values so that the NN learns the scaling anyway
#### Outputs
- [ ] We can try to let NN predict the right amount of speed for next step
